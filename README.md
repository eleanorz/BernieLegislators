# BernieLegislators
platform for promoting endorsers of Bernie Sanders / progressive congressional candidates.

For example, Nina Turner is running in xyz district.  Having our site pop up an ad for her to anyone with an IP address in her district.

Possibly, if we can get funding, we could dial in and target the demographics of people we think are mostly likely to vote progressive.

Here are a list of initial candidates we can build profiles for:

Nina Turner, Elizabeth Warren, Deray ??? [Baltimore Mayoral Candidate, technically].... also maybe we could just [grab a feed from this wiki page|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bernie_Sanders_presidential_campaign_endorsements,_2016]

## Help Needed

We need help getting content correctly.  Determining who is the most relevant candidate for us and also parsing out which IP address belongs where might be either very complex or data that is already readily available.
